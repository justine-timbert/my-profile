		<h1>Hello, I'm Justine</h1>
		<img src="images/picture Petite.jpeg" class="img-circle" width="200px" alt="Justine">
		<p>
		I'm from Fontainebleau in France 🇫🇷 and I joined Audencia in July 2022. If I had to be described in a few words it would be: <strong>travel, gastronomy and sport</strong>.

		<h2>Travel around the world 🛬</h2>
		<p>
		Since I was a little girl I have travelled every year with my family or with firend, which has allowed me to discover over 14 different countries. The last trip I made was to Mexico to visit my brother
		</p>

	<div class="card-white">
		<h2>Gastronomy 🥐</h2>
		<p>
		No matter where you travel the food will be different. 
		For some it doesn't matter what they eat, for me it's a real pleasure. I like to eat and drink good food, even more when I am abroad because it is the identity of a country.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="card-white">
		<h2>Sport 🏎</h2>
		<p>
		I played golf for 5 years when I was young and now I play occasionally. But one of the sports that fascinates me recently is Formula 1, following the teams, watching every grand prix....
